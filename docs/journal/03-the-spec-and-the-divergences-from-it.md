## The spec, and the divergences from it

The governing spec is `/Users/mattmarshall/Desktop/go_backend.md`, 32 lines,
`sha256 e546f63d814bb79f1dd64856554a70051e50a63552d086466bfd6fe518eebceb`
(verified at VS1 against the value the constraints were checked against).

Three divergences are named, and **two of them are different kinds of thing.**
Filing them the same way would put a false entry in the document a later reader
trusts most.

| # | What | Diverges from | Status at VS1 |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Dockerfile stage 1 is `golang:1.26`, not `golang:1.22` (DEC-09) | **the spec**, L31 | shipped |
| 2 | `go.mod` directive is `go 1.25.0` (DEC-27) | **a human ruling**, not the spec | shipped |
| 3 | A fourth compose service, MinIO (DEC-39) | **the spec**, L32 | **not in the slice** |

- **Divergence 1 is doubly forced.** A `golang:1.22` stage could not compile a
  module whose floor is `1.25.0`. Stage 2 is `scratch` exactly as L31 mandates.
- **Divergence 2 is NOT a spec divergence.** L17 says "Go 1.22 or higher", and
  1.25.0 satisfies it. It diverges from ruling 4's intent that the shipped
  binary and the development toolchain match — and raising the floor serves
  that intent rather than defying it.
- **Divergence 3 is not reached in the slice.** No object storage, no media.

**The slice is also two services where L32 asks for three.** Caddy is
**deferred, not declined** — see "Inherited unfinished" below.
