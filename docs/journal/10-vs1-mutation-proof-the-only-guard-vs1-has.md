## VS1 mutation proof — the only guard VS1 has

Run on the VS1 tree immediately before the VS1 commit. `docs/EVIDENCE.md` (VS8)
collects these at stated commits; this one is recorded here because VS1 predates
that file.

**Target:** the `gofmt -l .` step of `make check`, which is the one thing in
this step that guards anything about the source.

**The mutation** (a diff, because a mutation that does not change the file is a
green suite proving nothing):

```diff
--- cmd/api/main.go
+++ cmd/api/main.go
@@ 137a138,141
+
+func  unformatted( ) {
+_ = 1
+}
```

**Result — it reddens:**

```
go build ./...
go vet ./...
gofmt -l reported unformatted files:
cmd/api/main.go
run: make fmt
make: *** [check] Error 1
```

Note **what the mutation proves and what it does not**: `go build` and `go vet`
both passed the badly-formatted file, which is the point. Formatting is not a
compile error, so without the gofmt step nothing in the gate would have noticed.
Reverted, `make check` exits 0.
