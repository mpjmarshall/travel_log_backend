## What VS1 shipped that it was not asked for, and why

**`cmd/api/main.go`, a placeholder.** VS1's file list names `cmd/api/.keep`,
and its acceptance check is
`docker compose up -d && curl -sf localhost:8080/healthz`. **Those two cannot
both hold**: there is no Docker image of a Go binary that does not exist, and
no `/healthz` to curl. The check is the substantive one in an otherwise
artefact step, so the placeholder is what makes it runnable.

It is deliberately narrow:

- **It does not read `os.Getenv`.** VS2's acceptance check is that
  `internal/config` is the only file in the repository that does. A placeholder
  that has to be un-done to satisfy a later check is worse than one that is
  simply small. It takes `-addr` and nothing else.
- **`/healthz` answers a constant.** VS2 replaces it with a database ping so it
  can answer 503, and VS2's own mutation proof — "make healthz return a
  constant and the 503 leg reddens" — is written against exactly this. The
  placeholder is the pre-state that proof needs.
- **`.keep` was not created.** A `.keep` beside a real file is noise.

**`make up`, `make down`, `make logs`, `make fmt`.** Not in the step's named
target list (build, run, check, test-db, migrate, slice), and `test-db` and
`slice` both need the stack up. `fmt` exists because `make check` tells you to
run it.
